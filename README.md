```bash
Quran csv verse-by-verse

Convert Quran with audio for each ayah from either everyahah.com or quranenc.com
with subtitles using 82 csv translations.  The csv references the surah and ayah of each audio which corresponds with the audio of each audio mp3.  Like 002255 references surah 2 ayah 255 for instance. Subtitles can pretty much be 80 characters long otherwise subs get super small so the ayah needs to be intelligently divided up with up to 6 breaks depending on character length of ayah.  This is done super fast but for Japanese, Thai and Khmer it needs to tokenize each word so it knows where to make the breakpoint rather than breaking in the middle of a word.

download.py and files.json is for downloading audio using api of quranenc.com
duration_report.sh is used to gather duration of audiobooks like so

17h 54m Assamese - (Rafeeq)
19h 07m Chinese - (Suleiman)
18h 27m Dutch - (Rowwad)

Steps:
  A. Organize mp3 media into range subdirectories like so:
      quran_saheeh001-006_media
      quran_saheeh007-015_media
      quran_saheeh016-024_media
      quran_saheeh025-036_media
      quran_saheeh037-049_media
      quran_saheeh050-069_media
      quran_saheeh070-114_media
      This can be done automatically by putting all mp3 into a subdir named quranversebyverse then choosing 3. Organize mp3 media into range subdirectories

      === Organize MP3 media files into range subdirectories ===

        Moved 6236 mp3 files into range subdirectories.
        Left 112 bismillah file(s) (ayah 000) in place, not moved.
          quran_saheeh001-006_media/: 954 files
          quran_saheeh007-015_media/: 947 files
          quran_saheeh016-024_media/: 954 files
          quran_saheeh025-036_media/: 933 files
          quran_saheeh037-049_media/: 842 files
          quran_saheeh050-069_media/: 745 files
          quran_saheeh070-114_media/: 861 files
          (which totals 6236 ayahs)

      Once that's done use SubSticher to make opus chaptered audiobooks with csv (Anki convert to audiobook and choose csv)

      Language put Quran Arabic or Quran English
      Title should automatically fill with 001-006 depending on which csv is chosen and put reciters name after 001-006
      example: Quran Arabic - 007-015 Ghamadi Verse by Verse

      Audio Repetitions 1x (2x, 3x, 4x are for anki audiobooks)
      Bitrate 32 kpbs (since recitations aren't purely speak)

      check 'Use filename as chaptername' so surah 2 ayah 5 is 002005 rather 4 digits
      uncheck Sample Mode (50 entries)
      check Prepend Sura/Aya to subtitles
      check Match media by range (this automatically change 001-006 to 070-114 corresponding to selected  csv)

      Front column translation (this is the chapter name)
      Back Column (arabic, doesn't matter though only for 2x, 3x, 4x repetitions)
      Audio Column audio (this is the mp3)
      Sura Column sura (adds surah number before each verse in the vtt subs)
      Aya Column aya (adds ayah number before each verse in the vtt subs)

      Subsequent audiobooks just choose the next csv and it autofills the surah numbers and then in Column Selection section click Use Last (3,4,5, Sura 1, Aya 2) so needn't manually fill in again

  B. Remove translation info header, id column, footnotes column
  C. Normalize Arabic transliteration characters, remove reference & verse numbers
  D. Split into 7 range-based files (001-006, 007-015, etc.)
  E. Add Arabic text and audio from quran_saheeh source files
  F. (Optional) Generate translated VTT files from existing English VTT source files
     (long subtitle cues are automatically split into shorter ones → zsplit/Language/)
  G. (Optional) Zip zsplit folder for distribution

For Japanese, Chinese, Thai, and Khmer tokenization, install:
  pip3 install jieba sudachipy SudachiDict-core pythainlp[attacut] khmer-segmenter

Make sure to have in the root dir (reciter subs generated with SubStitcher):
  qurancsv.py
